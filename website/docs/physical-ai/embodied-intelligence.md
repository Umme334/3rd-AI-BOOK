# Embodied Intelligence

This is a placeholder page for the Embodied Intelligence section. Embodied intelligence refers to the concept that intelligent behavior emerges from the interaction between an agent's cognitive processes, its physical body, and its environment.

## Core Principles

- Intelligence is shaped by the body's form and capabilities
- Cognitive processes are influenced by sensorimotor experiences
- The environment plays an active role in shaping intelligent behavior
- Computation is distributed between brain, body, and environment

## Applications

- Robot control and locomotion
- Adaptive behavior systems
- Human-robot interaction
- Situated cognition models

## Research Areas

- Morphological computation
- Active inference
- Enactive cognition
- Situated robotics

This section will be expanded with detailed information about embodied intelligence concepts and implementations.
