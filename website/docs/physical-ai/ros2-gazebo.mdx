## Introduction

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is the middleware that enables communication between different components of a humanoid robot system. It provides the infrastructure for developing complex robotic applications.

## Core Concepts

### DDS Communication

ROS 2 uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) for message passing between nodes. This provides:

- **Real-time performance**: Critical for robot control
- **Distributed computing**: Nodes can run on different machines
- **Language independence**: Support for C++, Python, and other languages
- **Hardware abstraction**: Same code works across different platforms

### Node Architecture

In ROS 2, a robot system is composed of multiple nodes that communicate through topics, services, and actions:

```python
# Example ROS 2 node for humanoid robot control
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class HumanoidController(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__('humanoid_controller')
        self.publisher = self.create_publisher(String, 'joint_commands', 10)
```

## Gazebo Simulation

Gazebo is a 3D simulation environment that allows testing of humanoid robots in realistic physics environments. It integrates seamlessly with ROS 2 through:

- **Gazebo ROS packages**: Bridge between Gazebo and ROS 2
- **Physics engines**: ODE, Bullet, Simbody for realistic simulation
- **Sensors**: Cameras, LIDAR, IMU, and force/torque sensors
- **Plugins**: Custom plugins for specific robot behaviors

## Practical Exercise

Try implementing a simple ROS 2 publisher that sends joint commands to a simulated humanoid robot. The chatbot can help you with code examples and troubleshooting.
