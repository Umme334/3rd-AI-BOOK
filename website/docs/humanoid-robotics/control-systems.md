# Humanoid Control Systems

This is a placeholder page for the Humanoid Control Systems section. Controlling humanoid robots presents unique challenges due to their complex dynamics, multiple degrees of freedom, and need for stable, human-like motion.

## Control Architecture

- Hierarchical control structures
- Real-time control requirements
- Multi-rate control systems
- Distributed vs centralized control
- Safety and emergency systems

## Balance and Locomotion Control

- Zero moment point (ZMP) control
- Capture point theory
- Whole-body control approaches
- Model predictive control
- Feedback linearization

## Motion Planning

- Inverse kinematics solutions
- Trajectory optimization
- Path planning in dynamic environments
- Human-like motion generation
- Task-space control

## Learning-Based Control

- Reinforcement learning for locomotion
- Imitation learning from human demonstrations
- Adaptive control systems
- Neural network controllers
- Transfer learning between robots

This section will be expanded with detailed information about humanoid robot control systems and algorithms.
