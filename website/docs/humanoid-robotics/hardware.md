# Humanoid Robotics Hardware

This is a placeholder page for the Humanoid Robotics Hardware section. Humanoid robots are complex electromechanical systems that require sophisticated hardware components to mimic human-like form and function.

## Key Components

- Actuators and motors for joint movement
- Sensors for perception and feedback
- Structural frame and materials
- Power systems and energy management
- Control electronics and processing units

## Actuation Systems

- Servo motors and actuators
- Pneumatic and hydraulic systems
- Series elastic actuators
- Variable stiffness actuators
- Biomimetic actuation

## Sensor Systems

- Proprioceptive sensors (position, velocity, force)
- Exteroceptive sensors (cameras, LIDAR, tactile)
- Inertial measurement units (IMUs)
- Force/torque sensors
- Tactile sensing arrays

## Structural Design

- Lightweight materials (carbon fiber, advanced polymers)
- Anthropomorphic proportions
- Modular design approaches
- Safety considerations
- Maintenance accessibility

This section will be expanded with comprehensive information about humanoid robotics hardware design and implementation.
