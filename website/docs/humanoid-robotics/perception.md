# Humanoid Perception Systems

This is a placeholder page for the Humanoid Perception Systems section. Perception is crucial for humanoid robots to understand their environment, interact with objects, and engage with humans effectively.

## Sensory Modalities

- Vision systems (stereo, RGB-D cameras)
- Auditory processing
- Tactile sensing
- Proprioception
- Spatial awareness

## Computer Vision

- Object recognition and tracking
- Human pose estimation
- Scene understanding
- Visual SLAM
- Face recognition and expression analysis

## Auditory Processing

- Speech recognition
- Sound localization
- Noise filtering
- Natural language understanding
- Audio-visual integration

## Multisensory Integration

- Sensor fusion techniques
- Cross-modal learning
- Attention mechanisms
- Uncertainty management
- Real-time processing constraints

## Human-Robot Interaction

- Social signal processing
- Intention recognition
- Emotional state detection
- Gaze tracking
- Gesture recognition

This section will be expanded with comprehensive information about humanoid robot perception systems and technologies.
