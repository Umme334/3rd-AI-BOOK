## Key Features

- Distributed computing architecture
- Real-time performance capabilities
- Enhanced security model
- Improved cross-platform support
- Quality of Service (QoS) policies

## Core Concepts

- Nodes and communication
- Topics, services, and actions
- Parameters and lifecycle management
- Packages and workspaces
- Launch files and deployment

## Physical AI Integration

- Robot simulation and testing
- Sensor integration and processing
- Control system development
- Multi-robot systems
- Hardware abstraction layers

## Ecosystem

- Available packages and tools
- Simulation environments
- Hardware support packages
- Community resources
- Migration from ROS 1
