# RAG-Powered Chatbot for Physical AI

Our RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot allows you to ask questions about the textbook content and receive accurate answers based on the material.

## How It Works

1. The textbook content is indexed using vector embeddings
2. When you ask a question, it's converted to a vector query
3. Relevant content is retrieved from the vector database
4. The AI model generates an answer based on the retrieved content

## Try It Out

Use the chatbot widget on the right to ask questions about:

- ROS 2 architecture
- Gazebo simulation
- NVIDIA Isaac platform
- Vision-Language-Action models

## Integration with Other Features

The chatbot works seamlessly with personalization and translation features to provide a tailored learning experience.
