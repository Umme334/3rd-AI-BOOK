## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Script .specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh was not found, had to create PHR manually
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure PHR creation script is properly configured in project
