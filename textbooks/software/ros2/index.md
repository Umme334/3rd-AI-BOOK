# ROS 2 for Physical AI
This is a placeholder page for the ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) section. ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software that provides a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions for creating robot applications.
## Overview​
ROS 2 is the next generation of the Robot Operating System, designed to support the development of complex, distributed robot systems with improved security, real-time capabilities, and scalability.
## Key Features​
  * Distributed computing architecture
  * Real-time performance capabilities
  * Enhanced security model
  * Improved cross-platform support
  * Quality of Service (QoS) policies


## Core Concepts​
  * Nodes and communication
  * Topics, services, and actions
  * Parameters and lifecycle management
  * Packages and workspaces
  * Launch files and deployment


## Physical AI Integration​
  * Robot simulation and testing
  * Sensor integration and processing
  * Control system development
  * Multi-robot systems
  * Hardware abstraction layers


## Ecosystem​
  * Available packages and tools
  * Simulation environments
  * Hardware support packages
  * Community resources
  * Migration from ROS 1


This section will be expanded with detailed information about using ROS 2 in Physical AI applications.
