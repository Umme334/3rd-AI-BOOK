# Deploy your site
Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (also called **[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)**).
It builds your site as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**.
## Build your site​
Build your site **for production** :
    
    npm run build  
    
The static files are generated in the `build` folder.
## Deploy your site​
Test your production build locally:
    
    npm run serve  
    
The `build` folder is now served at <http://localhost:3000/>.
You can now deploy the `build` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost (read the **[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)**).
