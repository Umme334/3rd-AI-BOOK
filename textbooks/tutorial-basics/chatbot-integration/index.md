# Chatbot Integration in Textbook Pages
This page demonstrates how to integrate the RAG chatbot, personalization, and translation features into textbook content.
## Sample Textbook Content​
Welcome to the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics textbook! This content can be enhanced with our interactive features.
### ROS 2 Architecture​
ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) provides the middleware for communication between different components of a robot system. It uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) for message passing and provides features like:
  * Real-time performance
  * Distributed computing
  * Language independence
  * Hardware abstraction

## How It Works​
The chatbot widget on the right allows you to ask questions about this textbook content. It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide accurate answers based on the material you're reading.
The personalization toggle adapts the content based on your background and learning preferences, while the translation toggle allows you to switch between English and Urdu.
