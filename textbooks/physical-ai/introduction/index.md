# Introduction to Physical AI
This is a placeholder page for the Introduction to Physical AI section. Physical AI combines artificial intelligence with physical systems and real-world interaction. This field explores how AI can be embodied in physical agents like robots to interact with the environment effectively.
## Overview​
Physical AI encompasses several key areas:
  * Embodied Intelligence
  * Robot Perception
  * Motor Control
  * Environmental Interaction
  * Learning from Physical Experience


## Key Concepts​
  * How AI systems can understand and interact with the physical world
  * Sensorimotor integration
  * Physics-aware machine learning
  * Embodied cognition principles


This section will be expanded with comprehensive content about Physical AI fundamentals.
