  * Multilingual embeddings
  * Domain-specific translation models
  * Real-time translation systems


## Educational Localization​
  * Cultural adaptation of examples
  * Pedagogical approach adjustments
  * Curriculum alignment
  * Assessment method localization
  * Accessibility considerations


## Challenges in Education​
  * Technical terminology translation
  * Cultural sensitivity
  * Maintaining educational quality
  * Domain expertise preservation
  * Interactive content adaptation


## Urdu Translation Focus​
